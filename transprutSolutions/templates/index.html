          <p>
            You play a as courier in the concrete jungle maze known as Bucharest, delivering for glovo
            in order to try and make some extra money for a holiday abroad. In the city you have to
            battle with bad infastructure (Potholes that will kill you), horible and unpredictible
            (BMW) drivers that will do nothing to avoid killing you directly or indirectly (through
            explosions from car crashes), and corupt police trying to get your paycheck as a bribe.
            The player cannot directly kill the enemies (but can get them to kill themselves), this
            is left for the player to figure out.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game has 2 modes, Endless and Campain. In general the player must pick up a delivery
            (key), the arrow will point to it if not picked up, and then take it to a drop-off point
            (DropOff). In Campaign, the drop-off grants permission to leave (can-leave), and the
            ExitDoor ends the level once can-leave is active. In Endless, the loop is: key (delivery)
            → drop-off → new key (delivery), repeating forever. The arrow tracks the current target,
            in endless the player also has a small map on to show him the area where he must go (to
            make it less frustrating). During the gameplay loop, the player is targeted by policeman,
            bad infastructure (potholes) and BMW drivers that try to kill or bancrupt him, Potholes
            and BMW driver collisions result in an instant death, explostions will knock the player
            back and policemen will arrest the player if he runs out of bride money (HP). In Endless
            mode, dificualty scales over time: spawns accelerate the longer you survive, so the map
            gradually fills with more threats. The delivery timer adapts to player skill, finishing a
            delivery quickly reduces the next time limit more, while slower completions reduce it less.
